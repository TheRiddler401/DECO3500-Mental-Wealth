# DECO3500-Mental-Wealth

***

## Introduction to the Team

We, Mental Wealth, are a group of 4 individuals currently studying a variety of different programs at university to Bachelor of Information Technology to the sciences. Although generally autonomous with work distribution, there are two central roles - group leader and group communicator. The two roles share the responsibilities of overseeing the general direction of the project and ensuring each member stays on track throughout the project. The tasks of group leader and group communicator were tasked to Michelle Kwok and Elias Blanch respectively.

Being a group, once the significant domain for the group was chosen, each member branched out into tackling different areas and subdomains. These subdomains are outlined below:

**Samuel Riddell (45320763)** chose to tackle how the relationship of close families, the 2 parents and the child, and extended families such as grandparents can be strengthen to improve the mental wellbeing of the child.

**Michelle Kwok (45880164)** investigated the role finance management plays in the dynamics of coparenting, from the mutual distrusts of separated parents to the financial stress generated that impact the mental wellbeing of children involved.

**Elias Blanch (45801534)** [Extension on documentation] decided to focus on the childrens/ offsprings wellbeing by providing an effective, cheap, no conflict ssystem that would ensure the offspring weren't the middle person passing on information from one parent to another. 

**Madeleine Duncan (45329476)** [Extension on documentation] focussed on how to improve communication between separated families, specifically the parents, who have little to no communication, and thus improve the mental health of shared offspring as well as improve co-parenting.

Using the below link, a copy of **Samuel Riddell's** individual A4 poster can be found. This outlines the domain space, concept, and the process into constructing the final product.

### **Michelle Kwok**

As per the agreement of the group, I have created my own promotional poster of my product - CoParent Finances. The poster provides information on the problem space, possible solution and design insights informed by iterative investigation.

## Prototype Links

### **Samuel Riddell**

For the final product, I designed and created an interactive prototype using Figma. Using this, various buttons which link to different pages and functionalities of the website was created. There are 2 links below; one linking to the source Figma file and the other, the working prototype.

### **Michelle Kwok** 

My final prototype is a simulated experience via figma, where the user is placed in the shoes of a mother attempting to negotiate with her ex-husband about their shared childrens' finances. This high fidelity prototype places focus on the system's most unique feature which sets it apart from coparent communication software and personal finance apps - a messaging system with an asynchronous mutual payment system.

### **Elias Blanch** [Extension on documentation]

For my final prototype I used a website builder to create a simulated type experience where the user is Ezra, a father of one child- Becca- who has split with his partner Claire. The family is trying to plan each others lives while ensuring that Becca is kept in the loop of information. The focus of th prototype is the ability to view the other parents or childs plans and thus schecdule around that.

### **Madeleine Duncan** [Extension on documentation]
The final prototype for my application is a simulation made on Adobe XD. It is from the perspective of a mother (Tricia) who has split from the father (Robert) of their two children (Jimmy and Jeanie). This prototype allows the user to experience the application from what would be the parents' user interface, and experience features such as calendar , lost property, financial request and messaging. For the purposes of this prototype, only the 8th and 9th of September have been set up.
