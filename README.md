# DECO3500-Mental-Wealth

## Introduction to the Team

We, Mental Wealth, are a group of 4 individuals currently studying a variety of different programs at university to Bachelor of Information Technology to the sciences. Although generally autonomous with work distribution, there are two central roles - group leader and group communicator. The two roles share the responsibilities of overseeing the general direction of the project and ensuring each member stays on track throughout the project. The tasks of group leader and group communicator were tasked to Michelle Kwok and Elias Blanch respectively.

Being a group, once the significant domain for the group was chosen, each member branched out into tackling different areas and subdomains. These subdomains are outlined below:

**Samuel Riddell** chose to tackle how the relationship of close families, the 2 parents and the child, and extended families such as grandparents can be strengthen to improve the mental wellbeing of the child.

**Michelle Kwok** investigated the role finance management plays in the dynamics of coparenting, from the mutual distrusts of separated parents to the financial stress generated that impact the mental wellbeing of children involved.

For the final product, I designed and created an interactive prototype using Figma. Using this, various buttons which link to different pages and functionalities of the website was created. There are 2 links below; one linking to the source Figma file and the other, the working prototype.
